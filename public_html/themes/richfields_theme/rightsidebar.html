 <h1>Mortgage Protection</h1>
<p>If you, like most people, have a mortgage, you'll know that the repayments are one of your biggest monthly expenses. But have you considered the risks of losing your home if you couldn't repay your mortgage?</p>
<p><strong>Death -</strong> It isn't just emotionally devastating for your family; it can be financially crippling too. The last thing you or your family need at such a stressful time is the burden of financial worries. A life assurance policy can provide a lump sum to repay a mortgage and any loans in the event of death or illness. Not only will this ensure the home is not lost, it will reduce the burden caused from a lost income.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Illness </strong>- What would happen if you or your partner suffered a critical illness such as a heart attack, stroke or cancer and couldn't work? The loss of income could plunge you and those close to you into real financial hardship. Critical Illness cover and Income Protection plans can help take away the financial hardship in these circumstances. If you're fortunate enough to survive a serious illness or accident, you would receive a lump sum from your critical illness plan to repay any mortgages, and if your less fortunate is the reason why you should have life assurance.</p>
<p><strong>Sickness or Disability </strong>- You don't have to be critically ill to be unable to work. For example, if you had an accident at work, suffered from stress or a car accident, where will the money come from to pay the mortgage? It's fair to say that you can't rely on the State with maximum incapacity benefit only paying just over £85 per week. Payment Protection could provide the answer.</p>
<p>Whatever policy you choose, and whenever possible, you should always consider putting your policy in Trust. The objective of a Trust being to ensure that the right money (your policy proceeds) is placed in the rights hands (of your intended beneficiary) at the right time (claim).</p>
<p>Proper financial planning can, in the event of one of the above give you and your family peace of mind. The best way to make sure you're protected is to speak to an expert. Someone who can help you decide on the type and level of cover you need.</p>
